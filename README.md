### VideoMerge ###

This is a test project I'm working on to learn Swift and some new iOS 8 APIs. The final product is meant to allow you to select multiple videos from your camera roll and merge them into one video. It's a work in progress for the next few days - check out the commits to see where I'm at!

*UPDATE - 19th July 2014*
Merge videos complete! Now to add audio...

####Goals####
It's always good to have goals - so here's what I want to learn how to do in Swift / iOS 8:
- ~~View Controller setup~~
- ~~UICollectionView~~
- ~~ALAssetsLibrary, AVFoundation, CoreMedia~~
- New View Controller presentation API *(in progress)*
- Custom Transitions
